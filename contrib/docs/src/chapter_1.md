# Introduction

[Geoprox](https://github.com/ezrasingh/geoprox/) is a geospatial indexing and querying API designed to simplify and optimize location-based operations. It provides efficient methods for encoding and decoding geohashes, finding neighboring regions, and managing geospatial indexes for a variety of applications such as food delivery services and real-time inventory tracking.

## Key Features:

- **Geohash Encoding and Decoding**: Convert geographic coordinates into geohashes and retrieve coordinates from geohashes for easy location-based operations.
- **Neighbor Identification**: Quickly find neighboring geohashes to support spatial queries and region-based operations.
- **Geospatial Index Management**: Create, update, and delete geospatial indexes to organize and query location-based data efficiently.
- **Proximity Searches**: Perform radius-based searches to locate nearby resources or inventory items.

## Benefits:

- **Efficient Spatial Data Handling**: Streamline operations by leveraging geohashes for compact and hierarchical representation of locations.
- **Flexible Querying**: Use proximity-based queries to enhance real-time decision-making and operational efficiency.
- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrate Geoprox with applications for real-time tracking, delivery services, and more.
